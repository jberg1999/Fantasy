    "Fantasy football is a popular game played by millions of people around the world. Contestants draft a team of NFL football players and then are awarded points based on their players' performance each week. While there are opportunities for contestants to improve their teams throughout the season, the draft is by far the biggest factor that contributes to a fantasy team's success. There are a wide array of draft strategies, with no consensus about which one is the best. We are attempting to find the best way to draft a fantasy football team using data science techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have identified two data sets that will be used to inform our analysis. The first dataset is complete with player statistics, and more importantly, average draft position for the years 2010-2019. This dataset was compilied by FantasyFootballCalculator.com. The second data set contains fantasy statistics for players going back to 1970. This dataset is from FantasyFootballDataPros.com. Links to both websites will be below. We will use these datasets to compare players' statistical output with their average fantasy draft position. These insights may be used to inform more successful draft strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, is it important to draft a running back in the first two rounds? At what round should a contestant draft a quarterback? We plan to go through each position and each round, seeking to maximize the draft value of both. There are six positions in fantasy football; quarterback, two running backs, two wide receivers, and tight end. Most leagues also include defense and kicker although our datasets do not include these positions. We will find out which rounds to target each position. However, it is slightly more complicated than this. For example, if I am picking, but the top five running backs are gone, should I wait until round two to draft a running back? We will filter the data to exclude top players when seeking to answer these questions. At the end, all of these insights will be compiled into a single draft guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this project will require collaboration and hard work from both team members. We will meet weekly over Zoom to discuss progress and plan work for the next week. We set up a private GitHub repository to enable version control and easy sharing of each other's work. Where necessary, we will work on the project simulataneously using Teletype for Atom. This plan will allow us to work together while still maintaining compliance with social distancing guidelines."
